/*
    STL
    1. vector -> dynamic memory array that can resize and shrink
    2. list -> doubly linked list
    3. forward_list -> singly linked list.
    4. deque -> similar to vector and supports insertion and deletion at both ends.
    5. priority queue -> For heap data structure. e.g max and min heap
    6. stack
    7. set -> contains only unique elements
    8. multi_set -> like a set but allows duplicate
    9. maps -> store key value pair.
    10. multi_map -> duplicate keys but value should be different.
